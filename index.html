        <br>As this is no longer an option, this site will show another version windows has created to be played on their newer operating system as well as an online version.

        <dt>Step 3: Objective</dt>
        <dd> (From this step onward, both versions play the same.) </dd>

        <dt>Step 5: Resetting</dt>
        <dd>Sometimes you'll run out of moves. That's okay! You can reset the stock and try again as many times as you like!</dd> 
        <dd>Click where the stock was and it will reset itself.</dd>
        <dd>Repeat steps 4 and 5 until all cards are in the foundations or you run out of moves.</dd>
        <dt>Step 6: What if I get stuck?
        <dd>That's okay if you cant get any further! Just push the "New Game" button found at the top of the screen for the browser. For Windows, push "Try Again"</dd>

        <br>
        <br>Q: Are all games winnable?

        <br>
        <br>Q: Is the name of the game Klondike or Solitaire?
